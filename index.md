Dario Del Giudice <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('player').play()"> <i class="fa fa-volume-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is a scientist and engineer working at [NCSU](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/research/ewc/). He seeks to understand and predict the impacts of climate variability and human pressures on the quantity and quality of aquatic ecosystems. In his research at the interface of catchment hydrology and surface water pollution he leverages process-based models, stochastic methods for uncertainty
quantification, and computational statistics.

Dr. Del Giudice earned a PhD degree from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), an MSc from the [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html), and a BSc from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage). After moving from [Stanford](https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/), he is currently focusing on predicting how riverine nutrient loads and hydrometeorological forcings foster eutrophication and dead zones in critical systems such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.
